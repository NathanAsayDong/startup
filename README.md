CS260 Startup Project Website

IDEA: Idea: A software that takes user input homework assignments with structured parameters like due date, difficulty level, time required, class, etc. The program then take those variables and stores them in a database. The software displays a timeline chart onto the screen showing when and for how long a student should focus on that homework assignment to successfully complete the assignment. Additionally, features like goals, and incentives could be added as well.

**WEBSOCKET ADDITION:
-I plan on implementing live server data on my website by using websockets. I will use websockets to display the current time on the dashboard of my site so that way a user
can look at the time while they are working on their homework. I will also use websockets to display messages from teachers on a seperate page of the website. This will allow teachers (in theory) to relay mass announcments to their students in case of last minute updates or changes to do dates. That way students dont have to jump to email, learning suite, or canvas to check those announcments.
