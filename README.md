IDEA: Idea: A software that takes user input homework assignments with structured parameters like due date, difficulty level, time required, class, etc. The program then take those variables and stores them in a database. The software displays a timeline chart onto the screen showing when and for how long a student should focus on that homework assignment to successfully complete the assignment. Additionally, features like goals, and incentives could be added as well.
